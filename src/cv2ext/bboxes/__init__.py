Subpackage containing tools for working with simple bounding boxes.

Functions
---------
bounding
    Get a bounding box which encloses all the given bounding boxes.
constrain
    Constrain a bounding box to be within the bounds of an image.
draw_bboxes
    Draw bounding boxes on an image.
euclidean
    Compute the euclidean distance between two bounding boxes.
iou
    Calculate the intersection over union of two bounding boxes.
ious
    Calculate the intersection over union of a set of bounding boxes.
manhattan
    Compute the manhattan distance between two bounding boxes.
mean_ap
    Calculate the mean average precision of a set of bounding boxes.
nms
    Perform non-maximum suppression on a set of bounding boxes.
resize
    Resize a bounding box based on one image size to another.
score_bbox
    Score a bounding box relative to a target bbox.
score_bboxes
    Score a set of bounding boxes relative to a target bbox.
valid
    Check if a bounding box is valid.
xywh_to_xyxy
    Convert bounding boxes from `(x, y, w, h)` to `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.
xyxy_to_xywh
    Convert bounding boxes from `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to `(x, y, w, h)`.
xyxy_to_yolo
    Convert bounding boxes from `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to `(x, y, w, h)` in YOLO format.
xywh_to_yolo
    Convert bounding boxes from `(x, y, w, h)` to `(x, y, w, h)` in YOLO format.
yolo_to_xyxy
    Convert bounding boxes from `(x, y, w, h)` in YOLO format to `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.
yolo_to_xywh
    Convert bounding boxes from `(x, y, w, h)` in YOLO format to `(x, y, w, h)`.
